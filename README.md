# The Aim of this Project
In this Data, we will analyze reviews of the best rated and least rated hotels located within Europe to compare different aspects of rating and review text and monitoring customer behavior.
Hotel reviews are gold mine of customer insights for any hotel business. Also, its importance increases by many folds since majority of the future customers rely on the peer reviews while finalizing their stay
